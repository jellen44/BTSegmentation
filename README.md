# Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation using a 2D UNet

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 2D UNet Convolution Neural Network to segment regions of High-Grade Glioma brain tumors. The model implemented is based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).  The model was trained using data from the 2015 MICCAI BRaTS Challenge. For more information please see the [dataset](#dataset) section.

## Background / Overview
### What is brain tumor segmentation?
* What is brain tumor segmentation?
	* Process of separating healthy / normal brain tissues from tumor
	* Difficult because of irregular form and confusing boundaries of tumors
	* Time consuming for a radiologist to manually segment 
	* Segmentation tasks are ripe for machine learning / CNNs
### Data structure
* Explanation of data structure

## Installation
### Requirements
* Python 3.7.9
* Tensorflow 2.4.0
* Keras 2.4.0
* CUDA 11.0
* scitkit-learn
* scikit-image
* SimpleITK
* tqdm


### Setup
1. Install [Tensorflow](tensor flow.org), it is recommended that you have version 2.4.0+
2. Install [Keras](keras.io), it is recommended  that you have version 2.4.0+
3. Install [CUDA](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) and configure  GPU support for tensorflow
4. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/toehmler/nunet.git
5. Use pip to install all the dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
6. Download the data from the [MICCAI BRaTS Website](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html) 
7. Set `path_to_data`  in `config.ini`  to be the full path to the downloaded dataset.
8. Run the preprocessing script to perform N4ITK bias correction and rename the patient directories
`python3 process.py`

## Quick Start
